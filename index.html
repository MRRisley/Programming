	<p>
	Conceptually, a computer program is an algorithm: a set of rules, logic, and/or procedures in order 
	to accomplish a task. In order for the program to run, it requires a language that translates these 
	rules, logic, and/or procedures in a way that the program understands. Generally speaking, programs accept inputs 
	and translate them into outputs.
	<br><br>
	Considered from end-to-end, data analytics requires a broad range of programs in order to extract and deliver insights from data:
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>Data Acquisition and Pre-processing</li>
	<ul>
	<li>includes data queries, establishing data definitions, and preliminary cleaning</li>
	<li>throughout the project, it is usually necessary to return to this stage to introduce additional layers of granularity and segmentation </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Data Exploration</li>
	<ul>
	<li>this step includes data visualization, summary, and outlier analysis in order to understand the data</li>
	<li>often the universe of possible analytical solutions is narrowed in this stage as pieces of information are assigned greater or lesser importance</li>
	<li>in a work environment, the choice of program depends on the company you work for and the nature of the task</li>
	<li>also depending on the nature of the task, data exploration may be the extent of the analysis</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Data Analysis</li>
	<ul>
	<li>this step may include more focused analysis using statistics, modeling, algorithms, etc.</li>
	<li>the degree to which this step is successful is completely dependent on the success of the two prior stages</li>
	<li>analytics degrees give you the tools for this step, but real-world data is rarely ready for them as-is</li>
	<li>"garbage in, garbage out" is the mantra of analytics</li>
	<li>the key to success in analytics is a healthy skepticism of all data you see balances against a willingness
	to accept data as "good enough" after sufficient cleaning and review</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Insight Delivery</li>
	<ul>
	<li>through several iterations of steps 1-3, a summary and conclusion from the analysis is usually given to management</li>
	<li>nature of the delivery depends on the audience and their level of technical experience</li>
	<li>it may be completely appropriate to make no mention of statistics or modeling choices but only to deliver the results (executive or senior management)</li>
	<li>in other settings, it may be appropriate to dive immediately into technical details</li>
	<li>for non-technical audiences, it may be preferable to develop graphs/figures in Excel or Tableau as they are typically presentation-ready with little work</li>
	<li>for technical audiences, direct output from statistical software may be acceptable or even expected</li>
	</ul>
	</ol>
	<h5 id="intro_a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Types of Programming</h5>
	Most analysts work in multiple programming languages. While an Oracle Data Base (ODB) can be accessed within R,
	SQL will still be required to query the ODB. However, as many can tell you, R and SQL are very different 
	programming languages with different uses. There are generally classed into "paradigms" based on the features of
	the language, including whether the language specifies sequence of operations and where modifications can occur.
	In general, a programming language for data analysis is used for its procedural function. A language in the procedural paradigm 
	gives the computer specific operations to be completed in sequence. 
	For example, SAS's PROC statement and VBA's subroutine is at its most fundamental level a procedure. 
	<br><br>
	However, most languages share features of other paradigms. For example, R and Python also use concepts from the object-oriented paradigm,
	which includes objects and classes. Everything in R is an object of a specific class, which itself is usually an attribute
	of the object. For example, a 2x2 matrix in R is of class "matrix," and there are specific methods that can be used with
	a matrix object. (FYI--some purists will say a strict interpretation of object-oriented programming means that most R objects 
	are not true "objects".)
	<br><br>
	In general, an analyst does not need to know the programming paradigm of a language and will never engage in semantic debates about them. 
	However, it is helpful to understand the concepts and whether you're simply programming a procedure or programming an object. A procedure, 
	such as calculating the sum of two variables and storing it in memory, is generally self-evident when you see it within source code. 
	On the other hand, programming an object, such as telling the Excel application in VBA to spit out a user-friendly error for invalid inputs, 
	may be more difficult to understand. Working with programming objects, which are common in most languages, 
	requires knowledge of the universe of possible objects as well as the objects themselves. 
	<br><br>
	A list of common programs utilized for analytics and a description follows:
	<ol><br>
	<li>R</li>
		<p>R utilizes procedural languages C and FORTRAN for computation as well as the R language. It is a
		widely-used and flexible statistical computing software with some generalized programming ability. 
		It was developed in the 90s. As an open-source platform,
		users can submit packages that include functions, tools, and statistical procedures. There are currently thousands of
		packages. Most uses of R require installation and loading of several packages.</p>
	<li>Python</li>
		<p>Unfortunately, I know roughly nothing about the Python language, but it is gaining significantly more popularity. 
		It is similar to R in that it is open source with individual/joint contributors. In contrast to R, it is a more generalized
		programming platform. As with most programming languages, there are a vast number of resources on the web to get you started 
		if you're interested.</p> 
	<li>SAS</li>
		<p>SAS has been the workhorse of statistics for decades. Most dates in programs have
		numeric representation of dates in order to facilitate adding and subtracting. January 1, 1960 represents 
		the number 0 in SAS, which is around the time the software began to be developed. Excel users will likely recognize that
		Microsoft uses December 31, 1899 as the zero point such that January 1, 1900 = 1. 
		SAS is purely a statistical computing software that consists of two primary steps: DATA and PROC. DATA steps
		can create and manipulate data whereas PROC steps perform an action on the data. The SAS language is 
		primarily procedure-based, but there is some flexibility through user-defined functions and macros.</p>	
	<li>SQL</li>
		<p>For analytics in the private sector, SQL is almost universally a requirement for data retrieval, manipulation,
		cleaning, and segmentation. Corporations tend to rely heavily on Relational Databases, for which the SQL language
		was designed. SQL is generally unlike the three programs listed above. By itself, SQL (Structured Query Language) follows the 
		declarative paradigm: the query tells the program what it requires from a database and how to structure the results. 
		However, the structure of the results are not customizable beyond the SQL language. Importantly, however, there are 
		several procedural extensions to SQL, with PL/SQL and T-SQL being the most popular. These extensions bring procedural 
		elements to SQL, such as logic and loops. SQL is almost exclusively used with a procedural extension, which allows the
		user to customize the output through data definitions, etc.</p>
	<li>VBA</li>
		<p>Visual Basic (VB), the underlying language of VBA, is becoming increasingly obsolete outside of a handful of cases. 
		In fact, VB is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, its implementation in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) makes it a nearly
		ubiquitous feature of every corporation. Because of the heavy reliance on Microsoft applications, particularly Excel,
		VBA will continue to be relevant for computer programmers and analysts. VBA uses a host application (such as Excel) and
		allows the user to control the host application and its objects. VBA utilizes concepts from several programming language
		paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven. Unlike procedural and object-oriented programming 
		paradigms, execution of an event-driven program can be influenced by an end user of the program. For example, the user
		selecting "yes" to a prompt delivered by the program can alter the course of the program. As anyone who has used a macro knows, 
		the end user frequently does not need to know anything about VBA in order to use the developed program (referred to as a macro).</p>
	<li>Others</li>	
		<p>Plenty of other statistical computing and programming softwares are available to analysts, each with their merits
		and limitations. Some are better equipped for large-scale implementations of analytical solutions; others are 
		better equipped for day-to-day, smaller-scale analytical tasks. Many are open source because the coding/analytics community
		has thankfully championed democratization. Some of the softwares I've encountered are:
		<ul>
		<li>SPSS, Stata, EViews, and Power BI are off-the-shelf solutions
		for statistics and data, but they do not offer the general programmability such as R and Python.
		They have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides ease of use to those who do not require
		additional flexibility from programming.</li>

		<li>Tableau is a very popular program for data visualization and has a very large user base and following.
		It facilitates dashboard creation and works well with visualizing big data. As an off-the-shelf solution,
		however, it is difficult to add additional flexibility outside of the updates Tableau pushes out.</li> 
		<li>Hadoop and Spark are solutions for large-scale data and computations. They are useful production environments for 
		complex algorithms that work on large scale data. They are part of the Apache Software Foundation, which
		offers many other solutions (Cassandra and Hive, for example).</li>

	<h5 id="intro_b">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Programming Concepts</h5>
	Despite different types of programming, they involve similar concepts that are shared across languages.
	For example, object-oriented and non-object-oriented programming use variables and procedures such as functions.
	The syntax varies from language to language, but the concepts are shared. The concepts are:
