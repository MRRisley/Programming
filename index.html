	<p>
	Conceptually, a computer program is an algorithm: a set of rules, logic, and/or procedures in order 
	to accomplish a task. In order for the program to run, it requires a language that translates these 
	rules, logic, and/or procedures in a way that the program understands. Generally speaking, programs accept inputs 
	and translate them into outputs.
	<br><br>
	Considered from end-to-end, data analytics requires a broad range of programs in order to extract and deliver insights from data:
	<br>
	<ol>
	<li>Data Acquisition and Pre-processing</li>
	<ul>
	<li>includes data queries, establishing data definitions, and preliminary cleaning</li>
	<li>throughout the project, it is usually necessary to return to this stage to introduce additional layers of granularity and segmentation </li>
	</ul>
	<li>Data Exploration</li>
	<ul>
	<li>this step includes data visualization, summary, and outlier analysis in order to understand the data</li>
	<li>often the universe of possible analytical solutions is narrowed in this stage as pieces of information are assigned greater or lesser importance</li>
	<li>in a work environment, the choice of program depends on the company you work for and the nature of the task</li>
	<li>also depending on the nature of the task, data exploration may be the extent of the analysis</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Data Analysis</li>
	<ul>
	<li>this step may include more focused analysis using statistics, modeling, algorithms, etc.</li>
	<li>the degree to which this step is successful is completely dependent on the success of the two prior stages</li>
	<li>analytics degrees give you the tools for this step, but real-world data is rarely ready for them as-is</li>
	<li>"garbage in, garbage out" is the mantra of analytics</li>
	<li>the key to success in analytics is a healthy skepticism of all data you see balances against a willingness
	to accept data as "good enough" after sufficient cleaning and review</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Insight Delivery</li>
	<ul>
	<li>through several iterations of steps 1-3, a summary and conclusion from the analysis is usually given to management</li>
	<li>nature of the delivery depends on the audience and their level of technical experience</li>
	<li>it may be completely appropriate to make no mention of statistics or modeling choices but only to deliver the results (executive or senior management)</li>
	<li>in other settings, it may be appropriate to dive immediately into technical details</li>
	<li>for non-technical audiences, it may be preferable to develop graphs/figures in Excel or Tableau as they are typically presentation-ready with little work</li>
	<li>for technical audiences, direct output from statistical software may be acceptable or even expected</li>
	</ul>
	</ol>

	<h5 id="intro_a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Types of Programming</h5>
	Most analysts work in multiple programming languages. While an Oracle Data Base (ODB) can be accessed within R,
	SQL will still be required to query the ODB. However, as many can tell you, R and SQL are very different 
	programming languages with different uses. There are generally classed into "paradigms" based on the features of
	the language, including whether the language specifies sequence of operations and where modifications can occur.
	In general, a programming language for data analysis is used for its procedural function. A language in the procedural paradigm 
	gives the computer specific operations to be completed in sequence. 
	For example, SAS's PROC statement and VBA's subroutine is at its most fundamental level a procedure. 
	<br><br>
	However, most languages share features of other paradigms. For example, R and Python also use concepts from the object-oriented paradigm,
	which includes objects and classes. Everything in R is an object of a specific class, which itself is usually an attribute
	of the object. For example, a 2x2 matrix in R is of class "matrix," and there are specific methods that can be used with
	a matrix object. (FYI--some purists will say a strict interpretation of object-oriented programming means that most R objects 
	are not true "objects".)
	<br><br>
	In general, an analyst does not need to know the programming paradigm of a language and will never engage in semantic debates about them. 
	However, it is helpful to understand the concepts and whether you're simply programming a procedure or programming an object. A procedure, 
	such as calculating the sum of two variables and storing it in memory, is generally self-evident when you see it within source code. 
	On the other hand, programming an object, such as telling the Excel application in VBA to spit out a user-friendly error for invalid inputs, 
	may be more difficult to understand. Working with programming objects, which are common in most languages, 
	requires knowledge of the universe of possible objects as well as the objects themselves. 
	<br><br>
	A list of common programs utilized for analytics and a description follows:
	<ol><br>
	<li>R</li>
		<p>R utilizes procedural languages C and FORTRAN for computation as well as the R language. It is a
		widely-used and flexible statistical computing software with some generalized programming ability. 
		It was developed in the 90s. As an open-source platform,
		users can submit packages that include functions, tools, and statistical procedures. There are currently thousands of
		packages. Most uses of R require installation and loading of several packages.</p>
	<li>Python</li>
		<p>Unfortunately, I know roughly nothing about the Python language, but it is gaining significantly more popularity. 
		It is similar to R in that it is open source with individual/joint contributors. In contrast to R, it is a more generalized
		programming platform. As with most programming languages, there are a vast number of resources on the web to get you started 
		if you're interested.</p> 
	<li>SAS</li>
		<p>SAS has been the workhorse of statistics for decades. Most dates in programs have
		numeric representation of dates in order to facilitate adding and subtracting. January 1, 1960 represents 
		the number 0 in SAS, which is around the time the software began to be developed. Excel users will likely recognize that
		Microsoft uses December 31, 1899 as the zero point such that January 1, 1900 = 1. 
		SAS is purely a statistical computing software that consists of two primary steps: DATA and PROC. DATA steps
		can create and manipulate data whereas PROC steps perform an action on the data. The SAS language is 
		primarily procedure-based, but there is some flexibility through user-defined functions and macros.</p>	
	<li>SQL</li>
		<p>For analytics in the private sector, SQL is almost universally a requirement for data retrieval, manipulation,
		cleaning, and segmentation. Corporations tend to rely heavily on Relational Databases, for which the SQL language
		was designed. SQL is generally unlike the three programs listed above. By itself, SQL (Structured Query Language) follows the 
		declarative paradigm: the query tells the program what it requires from a database and how to structure the results. 
		However, the structure of the results are not customizable beyond the SQL language. Importantly, however, there are 
		several procedural extensions to SQL, with PL/SQL and T-SQL being the most popular. These extensions bring procedural 
		elements to SQL, such as logic and loops. SQL is almost exclusively used with a procedural extension, which allows the
		user to customize the output through data definitions, etc.</p>
	<li>VBA</li>
		<p>Visual Basic (VB), the underlying language of VBA, is becoming increasingly obsolete outside of a handful of cases. 
		In fact, VB is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, its implementation in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) makes it a nearly
		ubiquitous feature of every corporation. Because of the heavy reliance on Microsoft applications, particularly Excel,
		VBA will continue to be relevant for computer programmers and analysts. VBA uses a host application (such as Excel) and
		allows the user to control the host application and its objects. VBA utilizes concepts from several programming language
		paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and event-driven. Unlike procedural and object-oriented programming 
		paradigms, execution of an event-driven program can be influenced by an end user of the program. For example, the user
		selecting "yes" to a prompt delivered by the program can alter the course of the program. As anyone who has used a macro knows, 
		the end user frequently does not need to know anything about VBA in order to use the developed program (referred to as a macro).</p>
	<li>Others</li>	
		<p>Plenty of other statistical computing and programming softwares are available to analysts, each with their merits
		and limitations. Some are better equipped for large-scale implementations of analytical solutions; others are 
		better equipped for day-to-day, smaller-scale analytical tasks. Many are open source because the coding/analytics community
		has thankfully championed democratization. Some of the softwares I've encountered are:
		<ul>
		<li>SPSS, Stata, EViews, and Power BI are off-the-shelf solutions
		for statistics and data, but they do not offer the general programmability such as R and Python.
		They have a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that provides ease of use to those who do not require
		additional flexibility from programming.</li>
		<li>Tableau is a very popular program for data visualization and has a very large user base and following.
		It facilitates dashboard creation and works well with visualizing big data. As an off-the-shelf solution,
		however, it is difficult to add additional flexibility outside of the updates Tableau pushes out.</li> 
		<li>Hadoop and Spark are solutions for large-scale data and computations. They are useful production environments for 
		complex algorithms that work on large scale data. They are part of the Apache Software Foundation, which
		offers many other solutions (Cassandra and Hive, for example).</li> 	
		<li>H2O is an artifical intelligence and machine learning platform. It is available as a package
		in R and Python.</li> 	
		</p>
		</ul>
	</ol>

	<h5 id="intro_b">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Programming Concepts</h5>
	<p>Despite different types of programming, they involve similar concepts that are shared across languages.
	For example, object-oriented and non-object-oriented programming use variables and procedures such as functions.
	The syntax varies from language to language, but the concepts are shared. The concepts are:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><a href="#variables">Variables</a></li>
	<p>Variables allow the program to be dynamic. For example, a program can assign a numeric variable an approximately infinite
	number of possible values. In many programs, objects can also be treated as variables. For example, in VBA, you can 
	assign a specific worksheet to a variable (i.e., a worksheet object).</p>
	<li><a href="#functions">Functions</a></li>
	<p>For users of Excel, functions are a familiar concept. They take arguments (sometimes called parameters), which are then
	passed through the function's algorithm(s). For example, in Excel, the SUM function computes the sum of numbers. =SUM(1, 2, 3) 
	provides the sum of the numbers 1, 2, and 3, which is 6. In programming, it is common to create functions in order to
	automate a task that would otherwise require multiple lines of code.</p>
	<li><a href="#logic">Logic</a></li>
	<p>Logic is necessary for almost every program. It tells the program what to do if a certain condition is met (or is not met).
	This usually takes the form of an If...Then... statement and is one of the fundamental components of the procedural paradigm.</p>  
	<li><a href="#loops">Loops</a></li>
	<p>Loops are utilized across programming languages in order to perform many iterations of the same task. For example, if I 
	wanted to color every cell in an Excel worksheet based on its value, I'd need to loop through each cell within that 
	Worksheet. Even with thousands of cells, a loop condenses the procedure into only a handful of lines of code.</p>
	<li><a href="#format">Code Formatting</a></li>
	<p>It is very good practice to format code consistently and with commonly used standards. Never underestimate the power
	of whitespace, indentation, and comments for making your code more readable. Remember, code readability is not only 
	for posterity's sake, but for yours as well.</p>
	<li><a href="#debugging">Debugging</a></li>
	<p>Even the best programmer will encounter errors during development. Knowing how to work through the error is known as
	"debugging". The program usually has built-in error handling to notify the programmer of the type of error and the
	location. Errors can sometimes lead to an hour of head-scratching before the solution is found. Therefore, understanding
	basic errors and what to look for when they occur are important measures to maintain sanity while coding.</p>

<!--2. VARIABLES-->
<div class="docs-section">
	<h5 class="title" id="variables">2. Variables</h5>
	<p>Variables are a requirement of any program. They usually are of a specific type or "class," ranging from integers
	to variables of a specific type of object within the language.
	<br><br>
	Variables in programming offer flexibility. Imagine you are trying to program a calculator-type program that adds two numbers. 
	The user inputs these two numbers, and then the program displays the answer. Without variables, you cannot program all 
	possible inputs and outputs:
	<pre><code>
1+1 = 2
1+1.1 = 2.1
1+1.11 = 2.11
....	
	</code></pre>
	However, with variables, the task becomes much simpler:
	<pre><code>
x+y = answer
	</code></pre>
	In the first example, the program would have to search for the user inputs in a field of already calculated outputs. 
	In the second example, the program calculates the output (answer) based on the user inputs (x and y). 
	<br><br>
	Theoretically, a program cannot handle all real numbers because there is an infinite set: you can always add an extra decimal
	place to an already existing number. Under double point precision, for example, each number requires 8 bytes of memory. This generally
	results in precision up to 17 or so decimal places. Different variable types can frequently add additional decimal precision 
	if the nature of the problem requires it. Also, in cases where decimal precision is less of a concern than efficiency and memory usage,
	a variable type with less decimal precision is preferred.
	</p>
				<div align="center"><a href = "#top"><h6>Top</h6></a></div>
	
	
	
	
	<h5 class="title" id="numeric">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Numeric Variables</h5>
	<p>
		Numeric variables range from integers (no decimal precision) to float numeric variables, which replicate approximations of the real
		number line. Integers are counting numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) and can be negative. "Float" is shorthand for the fact that a 
		decimal place can occur anywhere in a string of numbers (i.e., it can "float"). In other words, float numeric variables have decimal 
		places. Floats can technically be integers (1 is an integer and a float) but integers cannot be a float (1.1 is not an integer,
		but it is a float). All programming languages will at least have these two numeric data types. For example,
		R uses decimal values by default. Even if variable x is assigned an integer, it is stored as a number with decimal precision. However, x can
		be coerced to an integer type. 
		<br><br>
		Beyond the basic integer and float, some programming languages offer variations of them
		that have different memory requirements and levels of precision. In T-SQL for example, the variable type <code>bigint</code> (short-hand
		for "big integer") stores integers from -2^63 to 2^63-1 and requires 8 bytes of memory. The variable type <code>int</code>, on
		the other hand, requires 4 bytes and ranges from -2^31 to 2^31-1. <code>tinyint</code> ranges from 0 to 255, which is equivalent to 1 byte. For those familiar
		with binary, 8 bits equals 1 byte, and 8-bit encryption allows 256 possible values. For float variables, two types are common: single- and double-precision
		floating-point. Single requires 4 bytes of memory while double requires 8 bytes. Some programs allow precision up to 16 bytes (128 bits).
		<br><br>
		You do not need to know bits and bytes in order to program effectively. However, in general, you need to know which types require more
		memory and why you might need them (i.e., for more decimal precision). It is also important to understand the types and the ultimate
		precision of your results. Consider the examples below from R and T-SQL. We're simply trying to divide 1/100, which represents 0.01, or 1%.
		<br><br>
		In R, the results are as we expect:		
		<pre><code>
> 1/100
[1] 0.01
		</code></pre>
		In T-SQL, they are not. The query below returns the result 0.		
		<pre><code>
select 1/100
		</code></pre>
		Why? R's default numeric variable type is a float. Therefore, the result can also be a float. T-SQL, on the other hand, 
		will "guess" your variable type. In the example provided, It encounters a 1 and a 100, both of which it reads as an
		integer. It then returns the result as an integer, which has no decimal precision. So, you get 0. In order to get the
		expected result, you need to coerce at least one of the numbers into a float. The code below returns the expected
		result by coercing 1 to a float through the built-in <code>cast</code> function.
		<pre><code>
select cast(1 as float)/100
		</code></pre>
	</p>
					<div align="center"><a href = "#top"><h6>Top</h6></a></div>
	
	
	
	
	<h5 class="title" id="strings">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. String Variables</h5>
	<p>
		Strings are usually used for non-numeric values, but virtually every character and symbol (<b>and number</b>) can
		be represented in a string. Strings are sometimes referred to as character(s). The following are all examples of strings. 
		I use the double quotation mark (") in order
		to denote the start and stop of a string. The use of quotation marks to designate strings 
		is common to almost every programming language.
		<pre><code>
"string"

"this is a string"

"stRing 123"

"string_123"

"123string"

"123"
		</code></pre>
		Note in the examples above that there are generally no rules on strings: Anything can be a string. 
		For data purposes, strings are common to use for categorical data. For example, if a car dealership's inventory were stored
		as data, one could imagine fields for vehicle characteristics such as color, make, and model. In these instances, these fields
		would be programmed as string variables, as shown in the data set below:
		<pre><code>
     Model    Color  
[1,] "Honda"  "Blue" 
[2,] "Honda"  "Red"  
[3,] "Toyota" "Black"
		</code></pre>
		In this example, both of these fields are strings, as denoted by the double quotation marks. However, not all
		programming languages will display quotation marks in output for string variables. This example was created in R,
		which always displays quotation marks in output to designate strings. T-SQL and SAS output, on the other hand,
		will not display the quotation marks.
	<br><br>
		The most counter-intuitive part about strings are the fact that numeric values can be strings. This can cause a
		host of issues that are sometimes dependent on the programming language. Imagine merging 
		two data sets that contain numeric account numbers. In the first data set, the variable type for account numbers
		is "string" to allow for
		leading zeroes. If not classed in this way, the account number string "099988" would become 99988 when evaluated as
		a numeric value. If the data type of the account number in the second data set is numeric, merging the data will likely result in 
		a "type mismatch" error. This is a result of the fact that, without any instruction to the program language, 
		string variables cannot be evaluated as numeric values and vice versa. In the R language, explicitly summing a character 
		value and a numeric value will return an error:
		<pre><code>
> class("15")
[1] "character"
> class(15)
[1] "numeric"
> "15"+15
Error in "15" + 15 : non-numeric argument to binary operator
		</code></pre>
		The first lines of code tell us that "15" is a character value and that 15 is a numeric value. The difference between 
		a string and a numeric in this instance is simply the use of the quotation marks. This is true of all programming
		languages I've worked with. When these two variables are summed in R, an
		error is returned letting us know that we're attempting to perform a mathematical operation on a non-numeric value,
		which the program cannot evaluate. 
		<br><br>	
		In other programming applications, however, the program will attempt to coerce a value to the appropriate variable 
		type. Consider the following line of code in T-SQL:
		<pre><code>
select '1' + 1
		</code></pre>	
		This code returns the value 2 without errors or warnings. Also, note that a string in T-SQL is represented through a
		single quotation mark (').
		<br><br>
		To complicate matters further, in some languages, it is impossible to tell visually whether a seemingly numeric value is truly 
		a numeric value. This is the case with SQL databases, which require you to examine the structure of the 
		table in order to determine the variable type of a field. Therefore, you may assume two numeric-seeming variables can
		be summed, and in many cases they likely can be without error. But if the query encounters an observation where this is
		not the case, an error will be thrown.
		<br><br>
		Finally, the last consideration for strings is case sensitivity. In most cases, such as in R and Excel VBA, programming languages treat
		"hello" and "Hello" as two unique strings. In other words, the two are not equivalent, as shown below.
		<pre><code>
> "hello"=="Hello"
[1] FALSE
		</code></pre>
		Therefore, in R, if you search the data 
		for "hello" and it is coded as "Hello", the search will not return any results. In other cases, like T-SQL and Excel VBA, 
		you can search	the data for "hello" and it will return any results that match it regardless of case. This disregard for
		case sensitivity is useful because you can find records that meet a criteria regardless of case. 
		If working with raw data in R, tidying the cases on string variables may be required where it is not necessarily required in a SQL
		query. Of course, almost all raw data needs tidying to some degree, but it is important to know whether the programming
		languages accounts for case with string variables. It is also important to know whether in the original data case did,
		in fact, matter. Otherwise, your analysis may incorrectly assume equivalence between "b" and "B", for example, which
		may not have been the intention of the person or system who created the data.

	<h5 class="title" id="booleans">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Booleans</h5>
	<p>
	Boolean variables are used for programming logic. They have two possible values: True and False.
	Most programs involve checking conditions and performing tasks (or <i>not</i> performing tasks)
	based on whether one or more conditions are met. For example, imagine a Bank charges two different interest
	rates depending on a borrower's credit score. For a high credit customer with a credit score of at least 700, the
	bank will offer a more competitive rate of 3.5%. For those who do not meet that criterion, the rate
	is 4.0%. Imagine a system is designed to automatically assign the rate when the application is processed.
	This logic would involve:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get the customer's credit score.</li>
		<li>Is the customer score >= 700? If yes, store True in a boolean variable. Otherwise, store False.</li>
		<li>When the boolean variable is True, return 3.5%. When False, return 4.0%</li>		
	</ol>
	<p>
	Evaluating conditions and utilizing boolean variables are a critical component to programming more complex tasks
	and to answering more complex analytical questions. 
	</p>
		<div align="center"><a href = "#top"><h6>Top</h6></a></div>






	<h5 class="title" id="other">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Other Variables</h5>
	<p>
	Given the flexibility required to accomplish tasks with a programming language, each language will likely have a 
	wide variety of additional variable types. 
	<br><br>
	One somewhat common variable type is a "catch all" variable type. For example, in the Excel VBA language, 
	<code>variant</code> variable types allow the variables to work with different types of values. During the course of
	a program execution, a variant variable type may at one point be a numeric, at another a string, and at yet another
	a Worksheet object. In general, it is advisable that when the variable type is known in advance to use the
	explicit variable type rather than a catch-all variable type such as variant.
	type in the Excel VBA language
	<br><br>
	The most common other variable type is an object variable. Precisely what kinds of objects are available depends on the
	programming language. For example, in R, I could have a variable that represents a vector or one that represents the output
	of a linear regression (referred to as a <code>lm</code> object). In Excel VBA, I could have a variable that represents 
	a cell, a range, a worksheet, or a workbook. As mentioned above, these object variables require the most specialized
	programming-specific knowledge as they are usually only relevant to one language.

	<h5 class="title" id="functions">3. Functions</h5>
	<p>
	Functions are self-contained programs that translate inputs into outputs. Even with no programming experience,
	you've probably already encountered functions. If I want to know the square root of 1,500 on a calculator,
	I'll use the <code>&#8730;x</code> button to return the answer. Pressing this button tells the calculator to perform
	the mathematical operation <code>x^(1/2)</code> (which itself is then a type of function). This conversion process
	is a function.
	<br><br>
	The most common example of a function and how one might use it in a program language is through the Excel built-in
	functions. Within a cell, I type the following: <code>=SUM(2, 3, 4)</code>. This uses the <code>SUM()</code> function
	in order to sum a series of <b>arguments</b>, which in this example are the numbers 2, 3, 4. Evaluating the function will
	return the result 9 in the cell. Excel has many, many more built-in functions, which you can see 
	<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/excel-functions-by-category-5f91f4e9-7b42-46d2-9bd1-63f26a86c0eb">here</a>.
	<br><br>
	As the universe of possible Excel functions makes clear, built-in functions typically fall into different classes. For example,
	there are string functions that parse or combine substrings (a string within a string). There are others that perform
	statistical operations, such as returning a random sample from a normal distribution. And there are others yet that work with
	dates, which is actually a very common programming requirement.
	<br><br>
	Outside of what a function is used for, there are two different types of functions: built-in and user-defined. The examples above
	are all built-in functions. These functions are "built in" to the programming language and generally do not require 
 	the programmer to do anything in order to use them. Therefore, when I pull up an instance of R, without loading any package,
	I can type the following and return a result.
	</p>
	<pre><code>
> max(1, 2, 3)
[1] 3
	</code></pre>
	<p>
	In this example, we can see that the <code>max</code> function returns the maximum of the inputs, which is 3. Maximum functions are
	built-in functions for most programming languages.
	<br><br>
        User-defined functions are functions built by the programmer. Many analytical and programming tasks require manipulation of
	data under a precise set of rules of formulas. Consider the following example. Say that a rental application approval requires three 
	criteria to be met: (1) credit score > 600, (2) no history of bankruptcies, and (3) no felony charges. A simple function
	can be created to automate the decisions. You could design a function to which you pass an applicant's name, and then the function evaluates
	these three criteria for the applicant. If they are all true, the program returns "Approved", but if one is not true, the program returns "Denied."
	Functions are frequently required for more complex analytical/programming tasks that require automation.

		<!--4. Logic-->
	<div class="docs-section">
	<h5 class="title" id="logic">4. Logic</h5>
	<p>
	In many cases, logic is a necessary component of any program. In fact, in more ways than one, logic is the <i>essence</i>
	of programming. Whether we realize it or not, our interactions with technology always involve a behind-the-scenes logic.
	Through sequences of actions, we interact with programs in order to fulfill wants and needs. We can ask our Google Assistant 
	or Alexa what the weather will be like tomorrow, we can change the channel on the television, or we can order a book on
	Amazon. All of these actions involve programming logic.
	<br><br>
	The foundation of logic is the <code>If...Then...Else</code>. Logic involves checking a condition, such as "Is it raining outside?"
	Depending on whether evaluation of the conidition is True or False, then we execute a decision. For example, if it is raining
	outside, you should take your umbrella with you. If it is not, you should not take your umbrella. Logic is integrated into 
	programming in the same way that it is hardwired into our decision-making processes. In many ways, the human brain is a
	metaphor for programming: Programs are artificial intelligence. 
	<br><br>
	Extending the <code>If...Then...Else</code> example above, logic in programming can be summarized with the following
	psuedo-code:
	<pre><code>
If {condition} Then {decision} Else {decision} 
	</code></pre>
	Importantly, a <code>{decision}</code> node may involve the decision to "do nothing," i.e., to take no action.
	<br><br>
	To put a real-life decision into the logical form above, imagine approaching a traffic light while driving. 
	Whether we realize it or not, the line of code above is executed in our brains. Of course, our brains are
	not always predictable: we may accelerate through a yellow light in some cases where we brake in others. However, to simplify
	this process in pseudo-code, we actually need to incorporate two "Ifs" in order to handle the three possible lights:
	red, yellow, and green.
	<pre><code>
If {light="red"} Then {press the brake} Else If {light="green"} Then {proceed} Else {be careful}
	</code></pre>
	The code above can be parsed as follows: If the light is red, then you will press the brake. The <code>Else If</code> then provides directions
	if the light is <b>not</b> red, which implies it is either yellow or green. Therefore, if the light is not red and if the light is 
	green, then you will proceed. The final <code>Else</code> means that the light is not red or green, which implies it is yellow. In this case,
	a driver has to "be careful": the driver has to make a quick judgment of the relative risk of stopping or proceeding. 
	This is difficult to program in a systematic way. However, given the advent of autonomous (driver-less) vehicles, this difficult
	decision-making process is being actively translated into programming statements. And, as you can imagine, this is why
	programming and analytics always involve ethical decisions.
	<br><br>		
	As the examples above illustrate, logic is used in programming to create decision trees. For example, if a user selects "Yes", 
	then the program will execute a sequence of events. Infinitely long and infinitely complex decision trees can be programmed
	simply from the <code>If...Then...Else</code> logic.

<h5 class="title" id="compound">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Compound Conditions</h5>
	<p>
	Frequently more than one condition needs to be evaluated in order to make a decision. Before deciding whether you need to
	take an umbrella with you, you may check whether it is currently raining <b>OR</b> whether rain is forecast in the future.
	Only one of many conditions may need to be true in this instance in order to make the decision "take my umbrella". 
	This is an example of a compound condition.
	<br><br>
	There are two common keywords used with compound conditions: <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>. Some languages use
	symbols for these keywords. For example, R uses <code>&</code> in lieu of "AND". Nontheless, the uses of  
	<code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> are equivalent across programming languages.
	<br><br>
	For those familiar with Venn Diagrams or probability, <code>AND</code> represents an <b>intersection</b>
	of two conditions. This means that both conditions joined by the <code>AND</code> must be satisfied. You can also 
	join an infinite number of conditions with <code>AND</code>.
	<pre><code>
{condition 1} AND {condition 2} AND {condition 3} ...
	</code></pre>
	<code>OR</code>, on the other hand, represents a <b>union</b>
	of two conditions. This means that <i>at least one</i> condition joined by the <code>OR</code> must be satisfied. 
	As with <code>AND</code>, you can join an infinite number of conditions with <code>OR</code>.
	<pre><code>
{condition 1} OR {condition 2} OR {condition 3} ...
	</code></pre>
	Finally, you can join <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code> in as many ways as required, but in these cases parentheses
	(or some form of bracketing) is recommended.
	<pre><code>
{condition 1} AND ({condition 2} OR  {condition 3})
	</code></pre>
